1. CTRL + SHIFT + F -> Formatting the lines.
	CTRL + SHIFT + O -> Takes care of import statement to some extent

2. Initially for the path of the webdriver which needed to be 
	a) constant variable = final
	b) that class need not to be inherited = final class [ as LoginPage only needs to extend Base Class only ]
	c) Others class won't create object of that class = private constructor
	only have a getter method to fetch the value as the variable is final.
	
3. Convert the project to testNG -> so that it will involve all the class under testng.xml which have testNg 
	annotations attached to them so that we can run	the complete suite at once.
	
4. BaseClass constructor is protected not private as we want no one should create an object from the class
	and it should be visible to the child class those who extends it.
	
5. Static methods can use static variables only.

6. Objects.isNull(driver) is same as if(driver == null) -> we r using this because any new joiner won't run that 
	method 2 times. But it will fail if we run the tests in parallel.
	
7. Understanding Thread Safety Issue:
	a. Scripts working fine whilst running sequentially but fails whilst running in parallel.
	b. All local variables are thread-safe. 
	[ Local variables stored in heap and their references are stored in heap and got removed once the method ends ]
	c. But the static variable is a class variable stored in heap and ends when class closes.
	
8. ThreadLocal:
	Helps to create variables that can be read and written by same thread.
	Easiest way to safeguard static variable during parallel execution.
