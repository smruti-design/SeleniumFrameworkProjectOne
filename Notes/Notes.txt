1. CTRL + SHIFT + F -> Formatting the lines.
	CTRL + SHIFT + O -> Takes care of import statement to some extent

2. Initially for the path of the webdriver which needed to be 
	a) constant variable = final
	b) that class need not to be inherited = final class [ as LoginPage only needs to extend Base Class only ]
	c) Others class won't create object of that class = private constructor
	only have a getter method to fetch the value as the variable is final.
	
3. Convert the project to testNG -> so that it will involve all the class under testng.xml which have testNg 
	annotations attached to them so that we can run	the complete suite at once.
	
4. BaseClass constructor is protected not private as we want no one should create an object from the class
	and it should be visible to the child class those who extends it.
	
5. Static methods can use static variables only.

6. Objects.isNull(driver) is same as if(driver == null) -> we r using this because any new joiner won't run that 
	method 2 times. But it will fail if we run the tests in parallel.
	
7. Understanding Thread Safety Issue:
	a. Scripts working fine whilst running sequentially but fails whilst running in parallel.
	b. All local variables are thread-safe. 
	[ Local variables stored in heap and their references are stored in heap and got removed once the method ends ]
	c. But the static variable is a class variable stored in heap and ends when class closes.
	
8. ThreadLocal:
	Helps to create variables that can be read and written by same thread.
	Easiest way to safeguard static variable during parallel execution. 
	
9. 	Reading property from properties file is like a hashTable - > slow but thread safe.
	if we have 100 of property and u r using 100 times its fine.
	But if we are using 500 times like continuous fetching from properties.file then convert it to hashMap.
	
10. Page Factory Method :
	Advantages :-
	1. Reduce verbosity
	2. Faster than find element
	3. Lazy Evaluation
	
	Disadvantages :-		
	1. StaleElementException - due to Ajax call
	2. Can't use to produce dynamic elements.
	Eg - private String menuitem = "//div[text()='%value%']/parent::a";
		public void clickMenu(String text){
			driver.findElement(By.xpath(menuitem.replace("%value%",text)));
		}
		The above isn't possible with Page Factory method.
		
		Over there you have to create a lot of elements for each Menu item.
		
	3. It's only very millisec faster than driver.findElement like if we run for 3 hrs the difference will be 5 mins.
	
	
11. AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) Calls :
	Let's say you're using a social media website, and you want to post a comment on a friend's photo.
	 Without AJAX, submitting the comment might involve reloading the entire page, 
	 causing a delay and interrupting your browsing experience.

	Imagine you're using a web application, and you click a button to submit a form or load additional information. 
	Traditionally, without AJAX, the entire web page would reload or redirect to a new page each time you perform
	 an action like this. This process can be slow and not very user-friendly.

	Now, enter AJAX. AJAX allows web pages to send and receive data asynchronously in the background,
	 without needing to reload the entire page. This means you can update parts of a page without requiring 
	 a full refresh.
	
	This makes the interaction smoother and faster for the user because only the necessary data is sent and received,
	 and there's no need to refresh the whole page.
	 

12. Page class should be free from assertions.
	All your page methods should return something.
	
13.	Instead of thread.sleep we can use uninterruptibles.sleepUninterruptibly(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
	Due avoid ajax calls as it may not be handled by explicit.
	Sometimes a simple thread.sleep makes life easy. That's the above.
	
14.	In java 8 -> wait.until(d-> d.findElement(webElement).isEnabled());

15. Subclass IS A Superclass. (IS A Relationship is mandatory)
16. When the sub class needs most or all of the methods in super class
	Rule : Don't use inheritance for code reusability alone.

17. The change business owner need to do put that in -> config.properties
	the change developer/ coders need to do -> Framework.CONSTANTS
	Use only one type of waits either explicit or implicit throughout the project.
	
18. Enum is used to define collections of constants.
	It can contain methods & constants.
	We can use EnumSet & EnumMap.
	Enum can't extend other classes.
	
	Eg - public enum Severity{
		CRITICAL, BLOCKER, MAJOR , MINOR ;
	}
	It's same as defining something as ,
	public static final ClassName CRITICAL = new ClassName();
	
19. DataProvider :
	
	Eg: @DataProvider
	public Object[][] getData(){
		return new Object[][] {
			{"smruti"},
			{1}
		};
	}
	
	2D array is not the return type of data provider everytime.
	What does Object[][] signifies ?
	If u r not clear about the data types of inputs u can give Object(superclass)
	1st Dimension -> How many iterations u want to run the test
	2nd Dimension -> How many parameters u want to feed to your test method.
